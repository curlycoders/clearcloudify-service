<h5><strong>Hybrid Cloud</strong></h5>
<p>A hybrid cloud is a cloud computing model that comprises a mixture of private cloud, on-premises, and third-party, public cloud services with coordination between these platforms. Most large-scale businesses across the industries are now opting for a Hybrid cloud model. The traditional private cloud model offers efficient handling of sensitive data, while the public cloud models are suitable for billing and resource flexibility. This hybrid model offers advantages of both the cloud models with features such as data privacy, better security, more tools, better dashboards, etc.</p>

<h5><strong>Multi Cloud</strong></h5>
<p>Multi-Cloud is a cloud computing model where a combination of cloud platforms is used. It can be two or more public clouds, two or more private clouds, or a combination of both public and private clouds. According to a study conducted by Accenture, 93% of companies are opting for a multi-cloud strategy due to its flexibility that enables the companies to adopt multiple cloud services from different cloud providers. This allows the companies to use their resources more efficiently.</p>
 
<h5><strong>Edge Computing</strong></h5>
<p>In this type of cloud computing, the computation is undertaken at or in the close proximity of the physical location of the data source. It is a cloud network system optimization method. This method will be especially beneficial with the telecom and IT industries as it helps in saving time and reduces lag in commands and cycle time.</p>
 
<h5><strong>Sustainability</strong></h5>
<p>Sustainability is the keyword in the coming years, and cloud computing can become one of the biggest trends in 2022 as it can reduce CO2 emissions by 59 million tons a year. The last couple of years has shown the world that only the businesses that have incorporated sustainability in their value system will be cherished by their customers. Therefore we can say that cloud computing can have a positive impact on the environment which will be benefited by the customers and businesses alike. </p>
 
  
<h5><strong>Cloud Automation</strong></h5>
<p>Automation makes life easier for all the entities involved. Cloud leverages automated services that can create a secure and efficient environment for a business. Cloud computing offers features such as Dashboards which enables the businesses to view all their activities on a single window, and simultaneously offers a chance to explore machine learning. Cloud computing also helps a business to create a secure infrastructure. All these features of cloud computing equipt a business to create more data and overcome existing challenges.</p>
 
<h5><strong>Containerization</strong></h5>
<p>The term containerization involves wrapping an application and all its dependencies in a condensed API library. It helps storing and moving all the components in a very effective way, thereby reducing the cost and efforts. Containerization also helps to improve scalability, security, and load times by a definite margin. Also, as this concept includes encapsulating all the components and servers together it also saves hardware and maintenance costs. </p>
