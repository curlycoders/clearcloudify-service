              <p>Cloud infrastructure management is the setup, configuration, monitoring, and optimization of the
components of cloud infrastructure. It happens through a web-based interface. Cloud infrastructure
management gives enterprises some level of scalability and consolidates IT resources. Users can share
the same infrastructure without compromising each others data.
</p>
<p>We help businesses in designing and building virtualized environments, migrating workloads,
databases, and IT systems to a cloud environment. Our services accelerate build and delivery through
rapid iterations, faster time to market, and lower costs.
</p>
<span>Our Cloud Infrastructure Management services include:</span>
<strong>Service Management</strong>
<p>We productize cloud functionality and enable administrators to have the right tools for the definition
and metering of service offerings. A cloud service offering is a set of applications and services that
end-users can consume on both public and private clouds. A service offering includes metering rules, guarantees, resource management, and billing cycles. Service management functionality must have a
link to the broader offering repository. This makes it easier for the user to deploy and manage defined
services.
</p>
<strong>Visibility and Reporting</strong>
<p>This is one of the key components of cloud infrastructure management. The lack of strong visibility and
reporting mechanisms makes it increasingly difficult to manage cloud infrastructure. It becomes
impossible to monitor customer service levels, compliance, system performance, and billing. Real-time
visibility and monitoring give administrators the ability to manage compliance, security, billing, and
other instruments seamlessly. They require high levels of granular visibility and reporting.</p>
<strong>Integration with Data Center Management Tools</strong>
<p>Most times, you will need to integrate new cloud management solutions with components of legacy
data centers. Legacy data centers have a variety of tools used for provisioning, billing, customer service,
systems management, security, directory, and others. Cloud infrastructure management solutions dont
replace these tools. Its, therefore, important to have APIs that integrate into existing OAMP (Operation,
Administration, Maintenance, and Provisioning) systems.</p>
<strong>End-User, Developer, and Administrator Dashboards</strong>
<p>Self-service portals and deployment models help shield the end-user from the complexity of the cloud.
This helps drive adoption and decreases operating costs since the end-user takes up most management
tasks. The user can manage his or her own virtual data center, manage virtual storage, and create and
launch templates. The user can also access image libraries and manage network and compute
resources. <br></br> 
Administrators should get a UI that gives them a single-pane view of all cloud resources. They should
see virtual machine instances, physical resources, service offerings, templates, and users. Developers
should also access all these features through common APIs.
</p>
<strong>Dynamic Resource and Workload Management</strong>
<p>The cloud must be resource and workload aware. Then, it will be truly on-demand and elastic and meet
SLAs (Service Level Agreements). Cloud computing virtualizes all data center components. The
resultant abstraction requires cloud infrastructure management solutions that can create policies
around workload and data management. This ensures maximum performance and efficiency for the
applications running in the cloud. This is particularly important when systems hit peak demand. The
system should dynamically prioritize resources on the fly depending on the enterprises priorities or
various workloads.</p>
<h6><strong>Benefits of Cloud Infrastructure Management</strong></h6>
<strong>No overhead of Hardware Maintenance</strong>
<p>The most significant advantage of incorporating cloud infrastructure management into your business is
the “zero server maintenance” it offers. Having no hardware on-site means no real-time maintenance or
up-gradation is required. Hardware systems should be replaced after a year or two that could cost you
money and time as it is a complex operation to carry out. <br></br>
With cloud computing services, you dont have to go through these time-laborious and expensive
procedures, letting you invest your vital resources in other important aspects.
</p>
<strong>Custom and Integrated Service</strong>
<p>Unlike physical IT infrastructures, cloud-managed service providers offer flexibility. You can ask for any
feature you want, and the providers will upgrade your package customizing it to your needs. All you
need is to pay for the extra services you are asking for. <br></br>
These custom cloud services help you save more money as “pay-per-service or payment plans” seem to
impact your growth and budgeting positively. The flexible features are available in security protection,
networking, monitoring, and all other setups.
</p>
<strong>Frequent Updates</strong>
<p>In hardware setup, you need extra time, labor, and money to bring some updates to your system, but
with cloud tools, the latest features are upgraded on a regular basis without asking. Most of the cloud infrastructure management suggests updates frequently (weekly or monthly). Besides, sticking to the
traditional approaches will only affect your services.
</p>
<strong>Data Backup</strong>
<p>Cloud infrastructure management helps the business keep a secure and lasting backup for all their
important documents. Comparatively, it saves money that you would be spending on hard disks, DVDs,
etc., to save the data. Consider it the cheapest method to assemble and save data along with creating
multiple backups through replication. <br></br>
Besides, cloud backup can be accessed from any part of the world anytime without interrupting the
internal processes. In case of any disaster, it also guarantees a fast and safe disaster recovery process.
</p>
<strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong>
<p>Cloud services can help your business control and minimize the overpriced network maintenance
expenses. Further, there will be no need to hire a full-time staff for looking out the IT structure. No
hardware equipment is required! No extra space is needed to save the data or set the servers! Cloud
computing cuts off expenditures on the devices that the company has been using.</p>
<strong>Fast Response Times</strong>
<p>Are you out of the country but need to access some important files? You can access the information
saved to the cloud from anywhere. It helps the business to give better and faster responses meeting the
needs of all users. Remote cloud infrastructure management has a quick response time.</p>
<strong>Reduced Energy Expenses and Less Carbon Footprint</strong>
<p>The highlight of using cloud technology is its feature to cut down your electricity bills as you will be
using only the hardware you need to keep the remote work in-flow. No extra servers, monitors, PCs, or
hardware, saving all of your energy costs. The cloud can reduce energy use up to 87% annually (as per
the resources). Cloud infrastructure management helps you make your future greener. Because you will
be using email and other electronic ways to communicate, lowering the carbon footprint and benefiting
the environment. <br></br> We help you modernize and migrate your legacy IT infrastructure to cloud enabled platforms to achieve
flexibility and agility.</p>
