               <p>Complexities in traditional IT infrastructure are posing serious challenges to organizations in catching
up the fast-changing market trends. This is where Cloud Computing performs the role of a savior,
addressing many business-critical tasks that require manual intervention, consume time and resources,
and are expensive.</p>
<p>Apparently, there is a growing cloud adoption globally owing to its abilities to handle heavy workloads
and provide enhanced mobility. However, on the other side of the cloud services utilization are some critical challenges that the IT industry is facing, such as support from the service providers, security,
storage, compliance and others. Cloud Monitoring has answers for these cloud-related challenges!
</p>
<p>A Cloud Monitoring Strategy is divided between Infrastructure Management and Configuration
Management, and typically involves:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Utilization of manual or automation techniques to monitor the performance of applications,
servers, etc.,</li>
<li>Assessment and evaluation of resource utilization, server response times, availability and
operating speeds to ensure possible issues are addressed well in advance</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cloud Monitoring Tools</strong>
<p>The implementation of any process is naturally backed by a set of tools and resources that make it
happen. Some of the popular Cloud Services Monitoring Tools are Amazon CloudWatch, Microsoft Cloud
Monitoring, AppDynamics, BMC TrueSight Pulse, New Relic, Hyperic, Solarwinds, ExoPrise, Retrace,
Aternity, Redgate, Datadog, Opsview, Logic Monitor, PagerDuty, Dynatrace, Stack Driver, Unigma and
Zenoss.</p>
<strong>Cloud Monitoring Benefits</strong>
<p>Cloud monitoring offers a wide range of solutions for a safe and secure cloud environment.</p>
<span>Some of the major benefits include</span>
<ul>
    <li>Quick installation backed by infrastructure and configurations in place</li>
    <li>Host maintains dedicated tools including hardware, relieving burden</li>
    <li>Scalability through usage of right monitoring tools for changing cloud activity</li>
    <li>Cost savings for subscription-based solutions without having to bear initial infrastructure or
maintenance costs, which are spread across multiple users</li>
    <li>Local infrastructure issues may not hurt the organizational servers and workstations maintained
by the cloud</li>
    <li>Availability of a wide variety of tools compatible to multiple devices over the network</li>
</ul>
<strong>Cloud Monitoring Best Practices</strong>
<p>Implementation of the right tools and resources can offer many benefits. We follow a set of practices to
effectively implement cloud monitoring.</p>
<span>Our cloud monitoring practices are:</span>
<ul>
    <li>Identifying key metrics and instances</li>
    <li>Effective data reporting through single platform</li>
    <li>Track service usage and expenditure</li>
    <li>Monitor and enhance user experience through regular feedbacks</li>
    <li>Ensure rules and services go hand-in-hand for effective utilization of resources</li>
    <li>Always store monitor data separately from related apps and services, and keep it accessible to
related stakeholders</li>
<li>Its always important to test your tools performance to ensure they dont fail when required</li>
</ul>
<p>As the number of cyber attacks rise, its important for cloud monitoring services to detect possible
breaches, identify security gaps, and secure the network well before an attack happens. <br/> Its time to add an effective Cloud Based Monitoring system to your cloud environment.</p>
