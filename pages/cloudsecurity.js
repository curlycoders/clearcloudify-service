                 <p>Cloud is instrumental to digital transformation. Organizations use cloud to rapidly roll out their
innovative digital products and services, modernize IT environments, and support hybrid deployment.
Consequently, cloud adoption has already reached remarkable levels and continues to grow. Just as
cloud adoption is a journey, Cloud Security is also an ongoing journey of incremental progress and
maturity, not a destination.</p>
<p>A right Cloud Security strategy will help your organization build secure, high-performing, resilient, and
efficient infrastructure for your applications. Our cloud security experts will monitor your infrastructure
and also build, maintain a broad selection of innovative security services, which can help you simplify
meeting your own security and regulatory requirements. Our security services and solutions are
focused on helping you implement your organizations optimal security posture by delivering the
following key strategic steps:</p>
<p><strong>Preventive</strong> - We will define user permissions and identities, infrastructure protection and data
protection measures for a smooth and planned Cloud adoption strategy.</p>
<p><strong>Detective</strong> - We gain visibility into your organizations security posture with logging and monitoring
services. We ingest this information into a scalable platform for event management, testing, and
auditing.</p>
<p><strong>Responsive</strong> - We automate incident response and recovery to help shift the primary focus of security
teams from response to analyzing root cause.</p>
<p><strong>Remediation</strong> - We leverage event driven automation to quickly remediate and secure your Cloud
environment in near real-time.</p>
<p>Our Information Security advisory (Clear InfoSec) offers you security services such as infrastructure
security, policy management, identity management, security monitoring, vulnerability management,
data protection, and consulting services. Our cloud security services help you deploy a comprehensive
security architecture and a more seamless experience across your cloud and on-premises
environments.
</p>
<p>Securing a software-defined datacenter using cloud-hosted tools enables capabilities beyond what
on-premises models can offer. Most of the organizations will treat cloud resources as another virtual
datacenter, effectively a starting point for Security of the Cloud. As organizations modernize using
Security from the Cloud, most will find themselves quickly outgrowing this model of thinking.</p>
<p>Security of the Cloud (securing cloud resources) - Security should be integrated into the planning and
operation of cloud services to ensure that those core security assurances are consistently applied across
all resources.</p>
<p>Security from the Cloud (using the cloud to transform security) - Security should immediately start
planning and thinking about how to use cloud technologies to modernize security tools and processes,
particularly natively integrated security tools. Increasingly, security tools are being hosted in the cloud
and providing capabilities that are difficult or impossible to do in an on-premises environment.
</p>
