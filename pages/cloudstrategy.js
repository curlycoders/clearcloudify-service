            <p>A Cloud Strategy is an essential practice that guides your organization towards achieving critical
business objectives that envisages the company to a multifold of favorable outcomes.
</p>
<p>Without a cloud strategy, an organization may try to accommodate a multitude of choices that often
conflict with each other and fail to guide the business towards achieving its important corporate goals.
With no cloud strategy, a firm doesnt have traceable business objectives and lacks the appropriate
focus for the key challenges that need to be solved.</p>
<h5>Cloud Strategy Objectives</h5>
  <ul>
      <li>Define the activities as well as the roles and responsibilities for accelerating the cloud adoption</li>
      <li>Provide an enterprise with a decision framework to evaluate opportunities in the cloud in
relation to strategic business objectives and a technology direction</li>
      <li>Establish a cloud implementation roadmap</li>
      <li>Determine the targets, measures and key initiatives that assist with continuous integration and
delivery</li>  
  </ul>
  <p>We derive the right cloud strategy of your organization with the following steps.</p>
  <strong>Define Business Objectives</strong>
  <p>Setting business objectives helps you to define exactly what your business wants to achieve by moving
to the cloud. The most effective cloud business objectives meet the SMART criteria: they are Specific,
Measurable, Agreed upon, Realistic, and Time-sensitive</p>
<ul>
    <li>Align with a larger strategic initiative. Having a cloud strategy ensures the tight alignment of the
target IT architecture goals, measures and key initiatives with the strategic business goals. It
encompasses a set of moves and actions that help an organization to reach its corporate
objectives.</li>
    <li>Define strategic goals for cloud adoption. From an enterprise perspective, cloud services
adoption provides a solution(s) to the problem(s) or challenge(s) that businesses face.
Companies investing heavily in a digital infrastructure desire to achieve one or several of the
following business objectives:
        <ol>
            <li>Quicker release of new services, products or business model</li>
            <li>Achieving operational excellence</li>
            <li>Acquiring and retaining new customers</li>
            <li>Upgrading the decision-making processes</li>
            <li>Gaining a competitive advantage</li>
            <li>Ensuring business survival</li> 
        </ol>
</li>
    <li>Assess business capabilities for cloud adoption. Business capabilities form the identity and
personality of an organization by outlining what an organization is good at. They are intangible
assets, such as resources, expertise and knowledge, thought leadership, technological support,
etc. Business capabilities are the outcome of investments in staffing, training, compensation and other HR areas. Differences in intangible assets, like capabilities, may explain why one
organization is more successful than another. Business capabilities mapping has emerged as a
core enterprise modeling technique, thus laying the foundation for cloud adoption.
</li> 
</ul>
<p>These activities are the cornerstone elements of cloud strategy that set the direction and focus for the
company to follow.</p>
<strong>Scope the current business context</strong>
<p>To define the current business context, we capture the macro-context of the business. The main
deliverable of a current business context analysis is to set up the business direction and define the
cloud needs based on the strategy. No doubt there may be gaps between the current capabilities and
those required to fulfill the cloud-enablement of a business.
</p>
<span>A business context analysis involves:</span>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Brainstorming sessions</strong> involving both stakeholders, decision-makers and IT specialists to
determine and evaluate the impact of a cloud adoption.</li>
<li>A <strong>SWOT Analysis</strong> applied to a cloud strategy assessment that can be used to create a matrix of
different cloud deployment models and how they serve the needs of the business. A SWOT
analysis also helps to evaluate the current IS system and leverages its strengths and
opportunities in order to overcome weaknesses and threats. Additionally, a SWOT analysis
facilitates assessing company operations and helps to determine the areas that need to be
improved. </li>
<li> <strong>Value Chain Analysis</strong> helps to determine what the primary activities are that create the most
value for the customer and whether the cloud improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the
processes.</li> 
</ul>
<strong>Assess the existing IT Architecture</strong>
<p>Focusing purely on a cloud technical implementation roadmap without taking into account the
business architecture is unlikely to deliver a truly holistic picture of the existing concerns. The objective
of an analysis is to create an understanding of the business IT architecture by defining its technical maturity as well as any factors that need to be improved or reworked along the path towards a flawless
cloud implementation.</p>
<strong>IT architecture analysis includes the following:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Assessment of the current IT enterprise architecture, applications, digital infrastructure,
interfaces, data governance policies, metrics and key objectives etc.</li>
<li>Evaluation of the current technical debt, caused by choosing limited solutions instead of better
ones and the implementation of which would take longer. Utilizing agile practices, continuous
integration and delivery firms can limit the amount of technical debt acquired. </li>
<li>Outlining the areas of concern from the two above evaluations and taking into account any
appropriate actions or further analysis.</li> 
</ul>
<p>We define the current, strategic, high potential, or key operational cloud support systems in the
McFarlan IT portfolio grid. Mapping the cloud infrastructure on the McFarlan IT portfolio grid helps to
match business requirements to the cloud and to evaluate how existing systems are contributing to a
company business objectives. It also assists in identifying how an organization can achieve any
strategic business objective by utilizing the cloud.</p>
<p><strong>Analyze the Future State</strong> The key objective of the future/target state analysis is to develop a vision of the
cloud-enabled enterprise architecture. This includes both business and technological aspects of the
cloud deployment. At this stage, the impact on business processes and operations is considered. Some
of the issues related to cloud transformation are linked to security constraints that narrow down the
choice of cloud platforms and cloud deployment architecture. The considerations that should be taken
into account are the authentication, identification, confidentiality and auditability options.
</p>
<span>The following tools can be helpful in defining the desired cloud state:</span>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Use Case Modeling and Analysis</strong> is used to determine the requirements of the cloud system and
set the overall scope for the cloud provider. This helps everyone to understand what needs to be
done so the business can achieve the maximum value from their cloud investment.</li>
<li><strong>Business Value and Benefits Assessment</strong> enables an organization to quantify the pros and cons
of the different cloud solutions, and thus choose a specific cloud solution by evaluating financial
returns (cost savings) and non-financial returns (operational risks).</li>
</ul>
<span>A business value and benefits assessment includes the following steps:</span>
<ul>
    <li>Determining and categorizing tangible and intangible value drivers, as well as the financial and
nonfinancial benefits, for the organization in the cloud.</li>
<li>Creating a cost benefit model and estimating some of the financial metrics (ROI, TCO, NPV, and
other tangible financial metrics) and critically assessing them within the cloud context.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Feasibility Study</strong>
<p>Conducting a feasibility analysis will help in moving the IT workloads to Cloud pragmatically.
Performing a Gap analysis will help identify the gaps and dependencies in proposed cloud solutions to
ensure there are no barriers to implementation or the migration plans.</p>
<span>To determine the strategic gaps that need further assessment regarding cloud investments, the
following evaluations can be taken:</span>
<ul>
    <li>Assessing potential technological and IT workflow gaps and opportunities for streamlining,
reorganization or simplification.</li>
<li>Prioritizing the potential cloud and other technology advancements that are needed.</li>
<li>Developing an action plan to handle the challenges and issues determined by the evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<span>Our Cloud Architecture team will provide two distinct strategies:</span>
<p><strong>Lift and Shift</strong> Create a clone of the current, in-house hardware and software and map it onto the
cloud. While no distinct technical or business benefits would be derived from this approach, it would
create comfort.</p>
<p><strong>Shift and Adopt</strong>  Break each existing application component and adopt the best services for the cloud,
enabling the organization to ensure the application is built for the cloud (not just on the cloud). Shift and Adopt was selected along with extensive document and training requirements. To implement
the strategy, we will perform a component-by-component analysis against the relevant Cloud service
offering.</p>
<strong>Risk Assessment</strong>
<p>Risk-aware cloud strategies are critical to the success of the business. A risk assessment helps to
determine and validate potential issues, and compiles the appropriate mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>Before an organization can assess or mitigate risk, it must first identify the likely risks that may occur.
There is no fail-safe method to identifying business risks, however companies can rely on their past
experiences to estimate what may or could happen.</p>
<p>A business risk assessment includes determining potential risks and then categorizing them into two
categories:</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Delivery</strong> - A risk of not delivering the required capabilities. e.g., relying on vendors, lack of scope
clarity, unorganized deliverables, poor project management.</p>
<p><strong>Risk of Benefits</strong> - A risk of not achieving awaited business benefits. e.g., lack of alignment of the
business with the IT department, misaligned technical standards in architecture, appropriate security
compliance, undefined metrics to evaluate business outcomes.
</p>
<p>After the risks are identified, they have to be prioritized in accordance with their likelihood of
occurrence.</p>
<strong>Implementation Plan</strong>
<p>The key objective of the implementation plan is to support the cloud delivery through a viable
implementation roadmap and resulting recommendations. The main activities include evaluating the
dependencies, along with the costs and benefits of different cloud transition projects. The prioritized
list of projects will form the foundation for the cloud implementation plan.
</p>
<span>The main deliverables of a cloud implementation plan are:</span>
<ul>
    <li>Establishing a management framework for cloud adoption that is in alignment with the strategic
business priorities, operations, project management, and data governance policies.</li>
    <li>Arranging resource distribution and capability planning to ensure the resource requirements are
fulfilled and the delivery is on track.</li>
    <li>Classifying and prioritizing cloud projects in line with the project sequence, timeline and key
milestones.</li>
    <li>Forming best practices and recommendations for a successful cloud implementation.</li>
    <li>Planning a governance process that ecompasses the management and assessment of the cloud
strategy and its implementation success.</li>
    <li>Integrating and documenting the cloud strategy.</li> 
</ul>
<p>We enable your Cloud adoption efforts progressively in alignment with the business outcomes,
therefore you are prepared for a successful cloud adoption journey.</p>
